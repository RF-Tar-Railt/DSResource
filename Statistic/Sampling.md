Sampling process of selecting a small number of elements (samples) from a larger defined target group of elements (Population) such the information gathered from the samples will allow judgments to the population. 抽样是从较大的明确目标元素组（总体）中选择少量元素（样本）的过程，从样本中收集的信息将可以对总体进行判断。
## Sample Surveys
Sample surveys are a special type of data collection that usually aim to discover the opinions of people on certain topics.  抽样调查是一种特殊的数据收集方式，通常旨在发现人们对某些主题的看法。

In a sample survey, a sample of individuals is selected from a larger population of individuals.  在抽样调查中，从较大的个体群体中选出个体样本。

The idea of sampling is to study a small part of the population in order to gain information about the population as a whole.  抽样的目的是研究一小部分人群，以获得有关整个人群的信息。

Conclusions drawn from a sample are valid only when the sample is drawn in a well-defined way. 从样本中得出的结论只有在以明确的方式抽取样本时才有效。

## Sampling Distortion
### Sampling Error

**Sampling error** is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population. 
- difference between $\bar{x}$ and $\mu$  (Sample mean and population mean)
- inevitable gap
**Non-sampling error** refers to all sources of error that are unrelated to sampling. 
- when there are problems with the sampling method, or the way the survey is designed or carried out.
### Sampling Bias

Sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have a lower sampling probability than others. 抽样偏差是指在收集样本时，目标总体中某些成员的抽样概率低于其他成员的偏差。

Examples:
1. A health organization wants to study the dietary habits of teenagers. They decide to survey students at a local high school known for its strong athletic program.       What types of sampling distortion are present in this scenario, and how might it influence the conclusions about the dietary habits of all teenagers? 一家健康组织想要研究青少年的饮食习惯。他们决定对当地一所以运动项目强而闻名的高中的学生进行调查。在这种情况下存在哪些类型的抽样失真？它会如何影响有关所有青少年饮食习惯的结论？
> Answer: 
> Sampling Bias
> The dietary habits reported may reflect the nutritional needs and preferences of athletes rather than those of all teenagers, that could lead to misguided policy recommendations or health initiatives aimed at the broader teenage population. 
> 报告的饮食习惯可能反映的是运动员的营养需求和偏好，而不是所有青少年的营养需求和偏好，这可能会导致针对更广泛青少年群体的错误政策建议或健康举措。
> 
2. A researcher is studying the average test scores of high school students in a district. They randomly select 30 students from one school, which happens to have a particularly high-performing academic reputation.                                                What sampling sampling distortion could occur in this scenario, and how might it impact the estimation of the average test scores for all high school students in the district? 一位研究人员正在研究一个地区高中生的平均考试成绩。他们从一所学校随机选择了 30 名学生，而这所学校恰好在学术方面享有特别高的声誉。在这种情况下，可能会出现什么样的抽样失真？这会对该地区所有高中生的平均考试成绩的估计产生什么影响？
> Answer:
> Sampling Error
> The average test score calculated may not accurately reflect the performance of all high school students in the district, may potentially influencing funding and resource allocation decisions. 计算出的平均考试成绩可能无法准确反映该地区所有高中生的表现，可能会影响资金和资源分配决策。

## Sampling Method

- **Probability sampling**: involves random selection , allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group. (quatitative reseach)
	- [[#Simple Random Sample]]
	- [[#Stratified Random Sample]]
	- [[#Cluster Sample]]
	- [[#Systematic Sample]]
- Non-probability sampling: involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data. (exploratory and qualitative research)
	- [[#Quota Sample]]
	- [[#Snowball Sample]]
	- [[#Judgment Sample]]
	- [[#Convenience Sample]]

### Simple Random Sample

Simple random sample  is a randomly selected subset of a population. 简单随机样本是从总体中随机选择的子集。
- Most straightforward  最直接
- Lower risk for research biases like sampling bias and selection bias 降低研究偏见（如抽样偏见和选择偏见）的风险
- High internal validity: randomization is the best method to reduce the impact of potential confounding variables. 高内部效度：随机化是减少潜在混杂变量影响的最佳方法。
- With a large enough sample size, a simple random sample has high external validity: it represents the characteristics of the larger population. 如果样本量足够大，简单随机样本就具有较高的外部效度：它代表了更大总体的特征。
- Simple random sampling can be challenging to implement in practice. To use this method, there are some prerequisites, you
	- have a complete list of every member of the population
	- can contact or access each member of the population if they are selected
	- have the time and resources to collect data from the necessary sample size

Simple random sampling works best if you have a lot of time and resources to conduct your study, or if you are studying a limited population that can easily be sampled. 如果您拥有大量时间和资源来进行研究，或者您正在研究易于抽样的有限人群，那么简单随机抽样是最有效的。
### Stratified Random Sample

Stratified sampling  involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways (e.g., gender identity, age range, income bracket, job role).  分层抽样涉及将总体划分为可能在重要方面存在差异的亚总体（例如性别认同、年龄范围、收入等级、工作角色）。
- Rely on stratified sampling when a population’s characteristics are diverse and they want to ensure that every characteristic is properly represented in the sample.  当人群特征多样并且希望确保每个特征在样本中得到适当的体现时，可以依靠分层抽样。
-  To use stratified sampling, you need to be able to divide your population into mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups.  **Every member of the population can be ONLY classified into one subgroup**.                                                                          要使用分层抽样，您需要能够将总体划分为互斥且详尽的子组。**总体的每个成员只能归入一个子组。**
- Best choice when you believe that subgroups will have different mean values for the variable(s) you’re studying.   当您认为子组对于您正在研究的变量将具有不同的平均值时，这是最佳选择。
### Cluster Sample

Cluster sampling  divides a population into smaller groups known as clusters (each cluster should have similar characteristics to the whole sample). They then randomly select among these clusters to form a sample. 集群抽样将总体划分为称为集群的较小群体（每个集群应具有与整个样本相似的特征）。然后，他们从这些集群中随机选择以形成样本。
- It is often used to study large populations, particularly those that are widely geographically dispersed.  它通常用于研究大量人群，特别是地理分布广泛的人群。
- Researchers usually use pre-existing units such as schools or cities as their clusters.  研究人员通常使用学校或城市等预先存在的单位作为其集群。
- This method is good for dealing with large and dispersed populations.  这种方法适合处理大量分散的人群。
- There is more risk of error in the sample, as there could be substantial differences between clusters.   样本出错的风险更大，因为不同聚类之间可能存在很大差异。
- It’s difficult to guarantee that the sampled clusters are really representative of the whole population.  很难保证抽样的聚类真正代表整个人群

### Systematic Sample

Systematic sampling is a method in which researchers select members of the population at a regular interval (or k) determined in advance.  系统抽样是研究人员按照预先确定的固定间隔（或 k）选择总体成员的一种方法。
- Applied with/without a list of the entire population 有/没有全体人口名单的情况下应用
- It’s essential to consider the order in which your population is listed to ensure that your sample is valid. 必须考虑总体的列出顺序，以确保样本有效。

You should not use systematic sampling if your population is ordered cyclically or periodically, as your resulting sample cannot be guaranteed to be representative. 如果您的总体是周期性或周期性排序的，则您不应该使用系统抽样，因为无法保证所得到的样本具有代表性。
### Quota Sample

Quota sampling is a sampling method that relies on the non-random selection of a predetermined number or proportion of units.  配额抽样是一种依靠非随机选择预定数量或比例的单位的抽样方法。
- It first divide the population into mutually exclusive subgroups (called strata) and then recruit sample units until you reach the quota. 它首先将总体划分为相互排斥的子群体（称为层），然后招募样本单位，直到达到配额。
- The aim of quota sampling is to control what or who makes up the sample.  配额抽样的目的是控制样本的组成。
- To gain insight about a characteristic of a particular subgroup or investigate relationships between different subgroups. 深入了解特定子群体的特征或调查不同子群体之间的关系。

### Snowball Sample

Snowball sampling is a sampling method where new units are recruited by other units to form part of the sample. 滚雪球抽样是一种抽样方法，其中新单位被其他单位招募来构成样本的一部分。
- useful way to conduct research about people with specific traits who might otherwise be difficult to identify (e.g., people with a rare disease) 对具有特定特征的人进行研究的有效方法，否则这些人可能难以识别（例如患有罕见疾病的人）
- downside here is representativeness due to the reliance on participants recruiting others, which leads to sampling bias.  缺点是由于依赖参与者招募其他人而导致的代表性偏差。
### Judgment Sample

Judgement sampling, also known as purposive sampling, involves the researcher using their expertise to select a sample that is most useful to the purposes of the research. 判断抽样，也称为目的抽样，涉及研究人员利用其专业知识来选择对研究目的最有用的样本。
- wants to gain detailed knowledge about a specific phenomenon rather than make statistical inferences, or where the population is very small and specific.  想要获得有关特定现象的详细知识，而不是进行统计推断，或者人口非常少且特定。
- Make sure to describe inclusion and exclusion criteria and beware of observer bias affecting arguments. 确保描述纳入和排除标准，并注意观察者偏见影响论点。

Purposive sampling is best used when want to focus in depth on relatively small samples. Perhaps would like to access a particular subset of the population that shares certain characteristics when you have a lot of background information about the topic. It is at high risk for research biases like observer bias. 目的性抽样最适合于深入研究相对较小的样本。当您拥有大量关于该主题的背景信息时，也许会希望访问具有某些共同特征的特定人群子集。它很容易出现研究偏见，例如观察者偏见。

### Convenience Sample

Convenience sampling simply includes the individuals who happen to be most accessible to the researcher. 便利抽样仅包​​括研究人员最容易接触到的个体。
- Easier and cheaper to access  获取数据更加容易且成本更低
- Ways to collect: online, social media post, in-person, crowdcourcing, pre-existing groups, ect..   收集方式：在线、社交媒体帖子、面对面、众包、现有团体等
- Higher risk of sampling bias  抽样偏差风险更高
